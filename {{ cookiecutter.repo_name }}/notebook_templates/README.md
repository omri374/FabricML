# Notebook templates

The purpose of notebook templates is to quickly create new Jupyter notebooks for experiments.

The template should be created after creating all the building blocks:
 - DataLoader
 - DataProcessor
 - Model
 - Evaluator
 - EvaluationMetrics
 
 It should include references to all these, to facilitate the creation of a new experiment, without having to reference all these manually or copy them from previous notebooks.
 
 See example here: [example_template.md](example_template.md)
